## Introduction
This section provides a descriptive overview of flight delays, focusing on cancellation rates,
delay severity, and distributional properties of arrival delays.
The objective is to quantify the magnitude of delays and identify structural characteristics
such as asymmetry and extreme values.

```{webr-r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helabhl/Flight-Delays-Analysis/refs/heads/main/qmd/data/flight_2024.csv"
df <- read.csv(url)
```
## Proportions of Cancelled and Diverted Flights
```{webr-r}

total_flights <- nrow(df)
canceled_flights <- sum(df$cancelled, na.rm = TRUE)
diverted_flights <- sum(df$diverted, na.rm = TRUE)

prop_canceled <- canceled_flights / total_flights
prop_diverted <- diverted_flights / total_flights

cat("Proportion of cancelled flights:",
round(prop_canceled * 100, 2), "%\n")
cat("Proportion of diverted flights:",
round(prop_diverted * 100, 2), "%\n")
```
Cancelled and diverted flights are excluded from the analysis, as they do not provide
an exploitable arrival delay measure.

## Removal of Non-Exploitable Flights
```{webr-r}

df <- df %>%
filter(
cancelled == 0,
diverted == 0,
!is.na(arr_delay)
)
```
## Flights with Positive Arrival Delay
```{webr-r}

df_clean <- df %>%
mutate(arr_positive_delay = ifelse(arr_delay > 0, 1, 0))

prop_positive_delay <- mean(df_clean$arr_positive_delay)

paste0(round(prop_positive_delay * 100, 2),
"% of arrived flights exhibit a positive delay")
```
A significant proportion of flights arrive late, confirming the relevance of the phenomenon
under study.

## Significant Delays (> 15 minutes)
```{webr-r}

prop_delay_15 <- mean(df$arr_delay > 15, na.rm = TRUE)

paste0(round(prop_delay_15 * 100, 2),
"% of arrived flights experience delays greater than 15 minutes")
```
## Severity of Delays Among Delayed Flights
```{webr-r}


flights_delayed <- df %>% filter(arr_delay > 0)

prop_over15_among_delayed <- mean(flights_delayed$arr_delay > 15)

paste0(round(prop_over15_among_delayed * 100, 2),
"% of delayed flights exceed 15 minutes")
```
```{webr-r}

table_delay <- table(
ifelse(flights_delayed$arr_delay > 15,
"Delay > 15 min", "Delay ≤ 15 min")
)

barplot(
table_delay,
col = c("lightgreen", "tomato"),
main = "Proportion of Delayed Flights",
ylab = "Number of flights"
)
```

A substantial share of delayed flights exceeds the 15-minute operational threshold,
commonly used as a regulatory reference.

## Distribution of Arrival Delays
```{webr-r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = arr_delay)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-100, 500)) +
labs(
title = "Distribution of Arrival Advances and Delays",
x = "Minutes (negative = early, positive = delay)",
y = "Number of flights"
)
```

```{webr-r}

ggplot(df %>% filter(arr_delay > 0),
aes(x = arr_delay)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "tomato", alpha = 0.7) +
coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500)) +
labs(
title = "Distribution of Arrival Delays (Delayed Flights Only)",
x = "Delay minutes",
y = "Number of flights"
)
```
```{webr-r}

boxplot(
df_clean$arr_delay,
main = "Boxplot of Arrival Delays",
ylab = "Delay (minutes)"
)
```
The distribution is strongly right-skewed with numerous outliers, justifying the use of
robust statistics and non-parametric tests.

## Summary Statistics
```{webr-r}

summary(df$arr_delay)
```
The marked difference between the negative median and positive mean highlights the influence
of extreme delays. While the median reflects punctuality, the mean is driven
upward by rare but severe events.

## Early Departures
```{webr-r}

early_departures <- df %>% filter(dep_delay < -15)
nrow(early_departures)
```
Early departures may reflect operational strategies aimed at absorbing anticipated delays
or systematic overestimation of taxi times.

## Conclusion
This descriptive analysis reveals that flight delays are characterized by:

* Strong asymmetry and heavy tails

* A non-negligible proportion of severe delays

* The presence of extreme events driving average performance

* These findings motivate further investigation into causal factors and temporal patterns.
