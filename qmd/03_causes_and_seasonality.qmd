## Introduction
This section investigates the underlying causes of delays and their temporal variability.
The objective is to identify dominant delay drivers and assess whether delays exhibit
seasonal patterns.
```{webr-r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helabhl/Flight-Delays-Analysis/refs/heads/main/qmd/data/flight_2024.csv"
df <- read.csv(url)
```
## Total Delay Minutes by Cause
```{webr-r}

library(tidyr)

cause_totals <- df %>%
summarise(
carrier_delay = sum(carrier_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
weather_delay = sum(weather_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
nas_delay = sum(nas_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
security_delay = sum(security_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
late_aircraft_delay = sum(late_aircraft_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
) %>%
pivot_longer(
everything(),
names_to = "cause",
values_to = "minutes"
) %>%
mutate(share = minutes / sum(minutes))

cause_totals
```
Airline-related and late-aircraft delays account for the largest share of cumulative delay minutes,
suggesting a strong propagation effect within the air transport system.

## Visualization of Delay Causes
```{webr-r}

ggplot(cause_totals,
aes(x = reorder(cause, minutes), y = minutes)) +
geom_col(fill = "tomato") +
coord_flip() +
labs(
title = "Total Delay Minutes by Cause",
x = "Cause",
y = "Delay minutes"
)
```
Internal and operational causes dominate exogenous factors such as weather or security.

## Internal vs External Delay Sources
```{webr-r}
internal_external <- df %>%
summarise(
internal = sum(carrier_delay + security_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
external = sum(weather_delay + nas_delay + late_aircraft_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)

internal_external
```
While external factors contribute significantly, internal causes remain a major lever
for performance improvement by airlines.

## Monthly Flight Volume
```{webr-r}
monthly_flights <- df %>%
group_by(month) %>%
summarise(total_flights = n())

ggplot(monthly_flights,
aes(x = factor(month), y = total_flights)) +
geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
labs(
title = "Number of Arrived Flights per Month",
x = "Month",
y = "Number of flights"
) +
theme_minimal()
```
Flight volume varies across months, reflecting seasonal traffic patterns: 
* The data suggests a summer peak (July) and a fall increase (October).

* Early months (Jan–Feb) have fewer flights, possibly due to post-holiday slowdown.

* Late months (Nov–Dec) show slightly lower numbers, possibly before the holiday surge.

## Monthly Distribution of Delay Categories
```{webr-r}
df_clean <- df %>%
mutate(
delay_category = case_when(
arr_delay <= 0 ~ "On time or early",
arr_delay < 15 ~ "Delay < 15 min",
arr_delay >= 15 ~ "Delay ≥ 15 min"
)
)

monthly_delay_dist <- df_clean %>%
group_by(month, delay_category) %>%
summarise(n_flights = n(), .groups = "drop")
```


```{webr-r}
ggplot(monthly_delay_dist,
aes(x = factor(month),
y = n_flights,
fill = delay_category)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
labs(
title = "Monthly Distribution of Flights by Delay Category",
x = "Month",
y = "Number of flights",
fill = "Delay category"
) +
theme_minimal()
```
## Monthly Proportions Independent of Traffic Volume
```{webr-r}
monthly_delay_prop <- monthly_delay_dist %>%
group_by(month) %>%
mutate(prop = n_flights / sum(n_flights))

ggplot(monthly_delay_prop,
aes(x = factor(month),
y = prop,
fill = delay_category)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
labs(
title = "Monthly Proportion of Delay Categories",
x = "Month",
y = "Proportion",
fill = "Delay category"
) +
theme_minimal()
```
Delay intensity varies substantially across months, combining both frequency and severity effects.

## Effect of Month on Flight Delays (Kruskal–Wallis Test)
**Research Question :**
Do arrival delays significantly differ across months of the year?

**Statistical Hypotheses**

* **H₀ (Null hypothesis)**
The distribution of arrival delays (arr_delay) is identical across all months.
→ There is no seasonal effect on flight delays.

* **H₁ (Alternative hypothesis)**
At least one month has a different delay distribution.
→ There is a significant seasonal effect on flight delays.

**Statistical Test**

A Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test was applied because:

* arrival delays are non-normally distributed

* extreme values (outliers) are present

* more than two independent groups (12 months) are compared
```{webr-r}
kruskal.test(arr_delay ~ factor(month), data = df_clean)
```


**Decision:** Reject the null hypothesis **(H₀)**.

**Conclusion:**
Arrival delay distributions differ significantly across months, confirming the presence of a strong seasonal effect.

This seasonal variability may be explained by:

* increased demand during summer and holiday periods

* adverse weather conditions during winter months

## Flight Volume vs Delay Severity (Spearman Correlation)
**Research Question**

Do days with higher flight volumes experience more severe arrival delays?

**Statistical Hypotheses**

**H₀ (Null hypothesis)**
There is no association between daily flight volume and arrival delay severity.

**H₁ (Alternative hypothesis)**
Daily flight volume is associated with arrival delay severity.

**Statistical Test**

Monthly aggregates were computed and analyzed using **Spearman’s rank correlation**, which:

* does not assume linearity

* is robust to non-normal distributions

* measures monotonic relationships
```{webr-r}
monthly_volume_delay <- df_clean %>%
group_by(month) %>%
summarise(
total_flights = n(),
mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)

cor.test(
monthly_volume_delay$total_flights,
monthly_volume_delay$mean_delay,
method = "spearman"
)
```


**Interpretation**
The results show a statistically significant positive correlation (ρ = 0.21, p < 0.001), indicating that days with higher traffic volumes tend to experience longer arrival delays.


**Decision:** 
Reject the null hypothesis **(H₀)**.

**Conclusion:**

Days with higher traffic tend to experience longer arrival delays,

but the effect remains moderate and highly variable.

In other words:

* Traffic contributes to delays

* It is not the dominant factor

## General Conclusion
This section demonstrates that:

* Delay causes are predominantly internal and operational

* Delays exhibit a seasonal variability

* Traffic volume alone does not explain delay severity

These findings provide a strong foundation for predictive modeling or clustering analyses
in subsequent work.
